In agent-based modeling, devising a policy to correctly simulate agent's behavior can be challenging. Reinforcement learning is used to train such a policy based on the given data. foxyNN offers such a training procedure with minimal efforts from users. Further guideline will be provided in the future upon completion of this project.
